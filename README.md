This is a place for the Humane Tech community to evaluate ideas, create strategies to realize them, and to plan activities and promotion to build up the community, make it grow and become more effective and influential. The project is primarily targeted to [Humane Tech Community members](https://community.humanetech.com/u) but anyone can participate.
